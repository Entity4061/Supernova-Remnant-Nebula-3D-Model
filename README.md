Supernova Remnant Particle System

This project visualizes a supernova remnant using a particle system in Three.js. The particles are arranged in an irregular, shell-like structure with distinct color layers to resemble the appearance of a supernova remnant.

## Features

- **Three.js**: Utilizes the Three.js library for 3D rendering.
- **Particle System**: Creates a dense particle system to simulate the supernova remnant.
- **Color Layers**: Particles are colored in distinct layers to enhance the visual effect.
- **Post-processing**: Includes bloom and FXAA post-processing effects for a more polished look.
- **Interactive Controls**: Allows users to interact with the scene using orbit controls.

## Installation
